## 🌸 About Me
Hi! I'm a curious pentesting enthusiast who loves CTFs, reverse engineering, and building little tools that make exploit work smoother. I split my time between TryHackMe practice, reading up on privilege-escalation techniques, and slowly turning notes into polished writeups. 💖

- 🔍 Focus: offensive security, CTFs (TryHackMe / HackTheBox), privilege escalation  
- 🧠 Current highlight: Top **3%** on TryHackMe (profile: <a href="https://tryhackme.com/p/moonweptsiren">`moonweptsiren`</a>)  
- 🛠️ Interests: small automation tools, exploit notes, practical writeups    

## 🌸 Projects (Coming Soon)
I’m actively collecting writeups, scripts, and tools from my CTF and lab work. Contents will be added here as I tidy them up — expect clear, reproducible notes and small helper scripts.  

- **[CTF Writeups](https://github.com/moonweptsiren/writeups)** → _Coming soon_: machine walkthroughs, challenge solutions, annotated steps.  
- **Pentest Tools** → _Coming soon_: my toolbox of small helpers & one-off scripts.  
- **Scripts** → _Coming soon_: exploit automation and workflow helpers.
